        <h3>1997 - ProGear and inSync</h3>
        <p>
          More than a simple catalog, the nearly 400-page ProGear becomes a
          respected technical reference resource for the industry. Sweetwater
          also introduces inSync, the industry’s first daily electronic
          newsletter, which continues to be published today.

          in size, welcoming more customers and becoming the largest music

          the future and can’t wait to invite you along on the journey.
          <p>
            If you ask how we measure our success at the end of the day, it’s
            the millions of happy customers and friends that are now part of the
            Sweetwater family.
          </p>
          <p>

            instruments, and promotions, and recruiting even more great people
            to the team, makes Sweetwater a great place to shop, work, and learn
            about the latest in music gear.

        <h2>OUR VALUES</h2>
        <h3>Do the Right Thing!</h3>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple — always do the right thing. Whether for
          customers, visitors, fellow employees, or business partners, our goal
          is always to exceed expectations and conduct ourselves with integrity,
          honesty, and respect for others.
        </p>
        <h3>We WOW Customers</h3>
        <p>
          Our customers are the reason we’re here. Helping them pursue and
          fulfill their musical ambitions and dreams is what drives us. WOWing
          customers each and every day is the single biggest focus of our
          efforts. We’re not motivated by squeezing the bottom line or gobbling
          up market share. Instead, we are relentlessly focused on bringing
          value to our customers. And it’s worth keeping in mind that customers
          aren’t always external. Even when interacting with other departments,
          we search for ways to deliver WOW.
        </p>
        <h3>We get things done</h3>
        <p>
          It’s called Sweetwater Time. We move fast. We make things happen now
          rather than spending days and weeks deliberating. If we have a
          question, we pick up the phone and ask. If there is a problem, we
          solve it now instead of tomorrow. If we see a wrapper on the floor, we
          pick it up instead of waiting for maintenance. We don’t make problems
          or solutions bigger than they are. We figure out a way to make a
          quick, positive impact right away and then look for ways to build from
          there.
        </p>
        <h3>We obsess over details</h3>
        <p>
          Not only do we want to get things done quickly, but we pursue
          excellence in everything we do. Excellence is the product of digging
          in deep and understanding how things work. How our coffee is brewed in
          the diner, font choices and colors on signage, specific words on an
          invoice or contract, the tone of voice on our auto-attendant messages,
          the way someone closes a conversation with a customer — the list goes
          on and on. All of this matters immensely. We obsess over details to
          make sure it’s not only done fast but done well.
        </p>
        <h3>We drive continuous improvement</h3>
        <p>
          What we are doing today won’t be good enough to WOW our customers
          tomorrow. We constantly strive for a better way to do what we do, and
          we reject the status quo. How can something in your area be done
          faster? How can we eliminate wasted time in one of our processes?
          What’s a new idea for making the customer experience better? “That’s
          the way it’s always been done,” isn’t good enough here. We always look
          for opportunities for improvement.
        </p>
        <h3>We develop the future</h3>
        <p>
          We do not lose sight of the future even in our pursuit of WOWing
          customers, working quickly, obsessing over details, and driving
          improvement today. We develop ourselves and work to encourage,
          challenge, and grow those around us. Saying a kind word. Pointing out
          someone’s strengths. Being willing to help someone learn a new skill
          or improve an area of their game. Giving positive and constructive
          feedback. Hiring team members that will take us to another level. At
          the end of the day, Sweetwater is people — and people are our future.
